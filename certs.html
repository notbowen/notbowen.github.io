                    <p class="cert-details">
                        In February 2022, I attended the 25th National Olympiad of Informatics hosted by NUS School of Computing.
                        I was close to a Bronze medal, and I just needed 5 more points to get it :(
                        <br><br>
                        However, I had learnt a lot about C++ from preparing for this olympiad, such as different algorithms
                        like binary search and greedy, time complexity, how different data types such as a vector or deque worked
                        and learnt about pointers.

                    <p class="cert-details">
                        My team and I participated in Ngee Ann's Amazing Race: Virtual Hunter 2022. We gathered
                        around 8k points and used them to buy ourselves a School of Infocomm Technology shirt,
                        along with other prizes such as an SD card, a thumb drive and a mousepad.
                        <br><br>
                        It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about image metadata and steganography,
                        and how they can be used to hide information :D

                        CTF.SG is a Capture the Flag competition focusing on areas such as Web,
                        Reverse Engineering, Cryptography et cetera. My team and I secured 40th place, with a score of 1782.
                        I learnt a lot about how hashes worked and even used MD5 magic hashes to get one of
                        the flags.

                            This was the first CTF I had attended, conducted by NYP, and I finished in the top 15.
                            I had learnt many new skills, such as the existence of robots.txt, basics of web servers,
                            CVEs, steganography and so much more.

                            Threat Hunting Challenge 2021 was a Blue team CTF challenge, organised by CSA and Elastic.
                            It taught me how to use Kibana and Elasticsearch to detect cyber threats, and I am proud
                            to say that I made it to the finals :D

                        HACK@AC is a CTF competition organised by ACJC in collaboration with CSA. It consisted of
                        Crypto, Forensics, Pwn, Reverse Engineering, Web and Steganography. My main takeaway from this
                        competition was how image steganography works.

                        CSA Singapore organised an Advanced YCEP Bootcamp, where participants did modules on various aspects
                        of cyber-security, such as Operating Systems, Recon, Metasploit et cetera. It deepened my understanding
                        of the Linux operating system and OS basics such as the shell and PATH.

                        This was the first computing event that I had attended, and I really improved a lot after going
                        through this event. It taught me the basics of AI using Teachable Machine, and even taught us
                        how to create a Chrome Dino game AI using python's NEAT library!
                        <br><br>
                        As a final project, my team and I made a "story telling bot", which used deepai's text generator
                        via their API to generate stories based off user input :D
